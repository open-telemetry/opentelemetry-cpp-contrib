# OpenTelemetry FFI Bridge for Rust and C++

This code demonstrates the creation of a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) bridge between Rust and C++ using the [cxx crate](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx). The primary goal is to facilitate interoperability between Rust and C++ codebases, particularly in the context of OpenTelemetry.

## Code Overview

### Create an FFI Bridge

The cxx crate is utilized to establish an FFI bridge between Rust and C++. A Rust module named ffi is defined using the #[cxx::bridge] attribute. Within this module, a Rust struct named TracerProvider is defined. This struct encapsulates a name field and serves as a data structure that can be accessed from C++.

An FFI function named get_tracer_provider() is declared within the extern "Rust" block. This function is designed to be callable from C++ and is expected to return a reference to a TracerProvider instance.

### Rust TracerProvider Implementation

A Rust struct named RustTracerProvider is introduced. This struct is designed to manage a TracerProvider instance. It includes a new() method that initializes a new RustTracerProvider with a default TracerProvider.

### Bridging Rust and C++ with a C Wrapper for OpenTelemetry Integration

By now CXX has some types that are intended to be supported "soon" but are just not implemented yet.

These types are necessary for the instrumentation and configuration of the C++ and Rust interaction within the context of OpenTelemetry.

To mitigate these issues currently, we can follow an approach by creating a C wrapper that acts as an intermediary between Rust and C++. This wrapper will handle these specific types, ensuring a smooth interaction between the two languages.

### Creating a C Wrapper for Rust and C++ Interaction

To address the impending types and provide a way to bridge Rust and C++ effectively, we propose the following steps:

1. **Define the C Interface**: Begin by defining a C interface that will be accessible from both Rust and C++ codebases. This interface should include functions and structures that mirror the expected types. These functions will serve as an abstraction layer for handling the complex types.

2. **Implement the C Wrapper**: In a separate C source file, implement the functions defined in the C interface. The implementation will act as an intermediary between Rust and C++, converting the data structures as needed and making the interaction seamless.

3. **Expose the C Wrapper to Rust and C++**: To access the C wrapper, expose its functions through the FFI mechanisms provided by Rust and C++. This involves creating external function declarations in Rust and including the C header in the C++ codebase.

4. **Utilize the C Wrapper**: In both the Rust and C++ code, replace the direct usage of the "soon-to-be-supported" types with calls to the C wrapper's functions. This ensures that data is properly converted and handled, regardless of the current limitations of CXX.

By adopting this approach, we can ensure a reliable and consistent interaction between Rust and C++ while awaiting the full support of the intended types in CXX. This strategy not only mitigates the current issues but also paves the way for a smoother transition once the desired types are officially implemented.
