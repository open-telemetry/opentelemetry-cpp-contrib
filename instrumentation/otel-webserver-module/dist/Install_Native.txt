Install the AppDynamics C/C++ Agent SDK
---------------------------------------

The AppDynamics C/C++ Agent SDK tarball from the download zone extracts to a directory named "appdynamics-sdk-native" that contains this file. AppDynamics recommends you extract the tarball to the /opt/appdynamics directory.

For up-to date instructions, go to https://docs.appdynamics.com/

1. Download the the C/C++ Agent SDK from https://download.appdynamics.com/

2. Extract the agent SDK.

   mkdir /opt/appdynamics
   sudo tar -xzvf appdynamics-sdk-native-<version>.tar.gz -C /opt/appdynamics

   The agent SDK installs to /opt/appdynamics/appdynamics-sdk-native.

3. Run the install.sh script to install the agent proxy. The agent SDK reports performance metrics to the proxy, which processes the data and passes it to the Controller.

      sudo /opt/appdynamics/appdynamics-sdk-native/install.sh

4. Run runSDKProxy.sh to start the proxy as a root user.

     sudo /opt/appdynamics/appdynamics-sdk-native/runSDKProxy.sh

     Note: Eventually you will want to set up the agent proxy as service set to automatically restart.

After you install the C/C++ Agent SDK, you are ready to instrument your C/C++ application using the API.
